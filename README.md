irBnB Clone Project
Part 1 - command interpreter
This project will entail:
Putting in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances
Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
Creating all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
How to use it:
Start up the console by typing ./console.
Type help to see what commands are available.
Examples:
(hbnb)create BaseModel

(hbnb)show BaseModel 22442c9d-2df8-4ad6-9877-fbebe5dc38eb
